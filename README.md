# School_District_Analysis

## Overview
The initial purpose of this challenge was to assist Maria in evaluating the data for school standardized test scores throughout the district. Upon discovering there was evidence for academic dishonesty at one of the schools withing the district, Maria has asked that we remove the math and reading scores at Thomas High School for 9th graders. 

## Changes By 7 District Metrics
### High and Low Performance
Strangely, even though my code was functional and appeared to correctly address scores following the removal of 9th grader score results, I was unable to detect any differences in multiple different areas. Namely High and Low Performance had ultimately no change in data values, despite it being the area where I expected the greatest change.

### Math and Reading Scores by Grade


### Scores by School Spending


### Scores by School Size
This category was far too broad to really exhibit any real changes based upon the given data.

### Scores by School Type
Again, as expected this category was far too broad to display any real changes in the results, but whether that was due to an error in code or exactly what should have happened, the world may never know.

Math Scores by Grade
-remove head function
Reading Scores by Grade
-remove head function
Scores by School Spending
- There are changes:
- 586 to 630 overall passing
- average math in 631 to 645
- MOST VALUES ARE CHANGED BETWEEN THE TWO
Scores by School Size
- Percentages did not reflect any change


## Sumarize four changes 
- Scores by school spending
- scores by school type - summarizing the lack of change
- math scores
- reading scores
